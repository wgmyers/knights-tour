# Knights Tour

A pure JavaScript implementation of the well-known Knights Tour puzzle.

Because, if you read about [Warnsdorff's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#Warnsdorff's_rule) and
don't immediately want to implement it yourself, I... I dunno.

Anyway, I really want to implement Warnsdorff's Rule.
